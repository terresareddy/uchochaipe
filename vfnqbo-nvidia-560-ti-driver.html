I've done a full config reset, I reinstalled the game, I've ran with both old and new nVidia drivers, I've turned vsync to all the different possible settings, nothing. I'm at a loss. Does anyone here have any ideas? Could DisplayPort play a part in this? Thanks After the default Graphics Card in my prebuilt Dell XPS 8300 gave out I decided to upgrade it.
